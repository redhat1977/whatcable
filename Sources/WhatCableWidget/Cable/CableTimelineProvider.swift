/// Every snapshot shown is "correct as of the last OS-triggered refresh."
/// The main app also pushes reloads via WidgetCenter on cable state changes,
/// which brings the widget up to date sooner when the app is running.
///
/// Data source priority:
///   1. Direct IOKit read (one-shot per provider run, no persistent watcher).
///      Works even when the main app is not running. The widget extension
///      sandbox permits IOKit registry reads (proven by the App Store
///      feasibility study).
///   2. App Group snapshot written by the main app. Used as fallback when
///      the IOKit read returns nothing (empty port list) or fails.
///
/// Staleness blanking has been removed. An old snapshot is still useful;
/// the "as of HH:MM" caption tells the user when it was captured.
