// Corpus-replay coverage for `HPMPortUUIDMap` (Reading/HPMPortUUIDMap.swift)
// over probe 35 (`35_hpm_port_uuid.json`), which had zero corpus coverage
// before this file (`WatcherCorpusSweepTests.swift` covers `.normalise` only).
//
// SEAM NOTE: `HPMPortUUIDMap.current()` is unreachable from a test -- it walks
// live `AppleHPMDeviceHALType3` IOKit services directly, with no `read`
// closure seam at all. `HPMPortUUIDMap.from(ports:)`, by contrast, is fully
// reachable: it takes a plain `[AppleHPMInterface]` array, and
// `AppleHPMInterface.from(...)` (the public factory already covered by
// `WatcherCorpusSweepTests.swift`'s HPM sweep) builds those from a `read`
// closure with no IOKit involved. This file drives `.from(ports:)` with
// `AppleHPMInterface` values built the same production way, fed from probe
// 35's ground-truth port/UUID pairs, so both the join (`.from`) and the
// normalisation (`.normalise`, exercised indirectly here too) run against
// real per-machine UUID sets.
//
// Probe 35 format (verified against the corpus, 2026-07). UUIDs below are
// SYNTHETIC placeholders: an earlier version of this comment pasted two REAL
// contributor UUIDs from the corpus straight into tracked test source, which is
// exactly the leak the privacy rule below exists to prevent (Codex review, #403).
//   [0] Port-USB-C@3        class=AppleHPMDeviceHALType3
//         UUID=AAAAAAAA-BBBB-CCCC-DDDD-EEEEEEEEEEEE  RID=2  Address=12
//         ConnectionUUID=11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555

//         UUID=...
//   [2] (no port child)     class=AppleHPMDevice          <- controller, NOT a port
//
// PRIVACY: UUIDs are an internal join key only (see HPMPortUUIDMap's own
// doc comment and MEMORY.md "UUID/UID is private research data"). Assertion
// messages below only ever print an 8-char truncated prefix, never the full
// value, matching that rule even in local test failure output.

    // CLAUDE.md flags this explicitly: the `@N` socket suffix on a power-only
    // (MagSafe) port can collide with the first USB-C port on the same HPM
    // controller (issue #195). HPMPortUUIDMap must keep them apart because
    // MagSafe and USB-C use different rawType prefixes (17 vs 2) even when N
    // is identical. Restated here as a fixture because it is easy for a
    // future edit to `expectedPortKey`'s reasoning (or the production
    // `portKey` computed property it mirrors) to silently collapse this case,
    // and the real corpus may not always have a same-@N MagSafe/USB-C pair on
    // disk to catch it via the sweep alone.
